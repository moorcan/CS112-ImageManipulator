# Reflection 

* Thankfully, because I worked so diligently on the last assignment, I feel as though this assignment was easier because
I had most of the logic already panned out. There were a few questions I had initally, like, how was I going to go through the options. Looking back on old assignments, I realized that the switch case might be a viable option, but I only remembered it being used with a char. This intitution turned out to be correct. 

* I would reccomend students get a jump start on their assignment because I feel like this assignment was forgiving to the prepared student. I would also advise students to coloaborate. I have found it to be extremely helpful when trying to reason through my logic or trying to figure out where my syntax is off, I find that having a second pair of eyes is extremely ==. 

* There were several aspects of this assignment that were rewarding but frustrating. It was difficult for me to go through my code on my own to figure out the few little syntax issues. While I feel like my ability to slowly work through the logic is coming along, there will still be sevearl times that I'm stuck just like I was for the last 3 days. I find that I need to do atleast one hour of prggramming a day, but I'm still trying to learn how to be independent on myself and learn how to better utilize my resources. 

* This week was clearly special due to the fact that we were without power for a few days, butI I still felt like I had given myself enough of a buffer with the other labs and homework to not have that outage affect me as much. I think the interactive aspect of this class is really engaging and refreshing. I like that we are encouraged to collaborate and the activies last Tuedsay were quite greate, even though I wasn't able to finish in time. 

* This asignment really stressed the importance of not reinventing the wheel. I like that we are encouraged to use what ever resource we have with in reason.
